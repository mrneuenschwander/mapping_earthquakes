# mapping_earthquakes
GeoJSON and Plotting with JavaScript

This project has no written requirement.
### Purpose
To show visually the magnitudes and locations of earthquakes worldwide over the last 7 days, in addition to the associated tectonics. An additional filter is available to show major quakes (Mag 4.5+) on their own if desired. 3 different map views are available: a Street view, a Satellite Street view, and a Dark view, which the map will default to on load or reload.
